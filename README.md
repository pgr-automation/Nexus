# Nexus

As a DevOps engineer, understanding Nexus is essential for managing dependencies, artifacts, and ensuring secure software delivery pipelines. Nexus, particularly Sonatype Nexus, is widely used as a repository manager to store, manage, and deploy software artifacts. Here's a breakdown of what you should focus on:
1. Introduction to Nexus

    What Nexus is: Repository manager for managing binaries and dependencies.
    Nexus Types:
        Nexus Repository OSS: Free, open-source version.
        Nexus Repository Pro: Paid version with additional features.
    Core Use Cases:
        Storing Maven, npm, Python (PyPI), Docker images, etc.
        Acting as a proxy for remote repositories (e.g., Maven Central, npm registry).

2. Repository Basics

    Types of Repositories:
        Hosted: Internal artifacts stored for later use.
        Proxy: Caching dependencies from remote repositories.
        Group: Aggregates multiple repositories for simplified access.
    Supported Formats:
        Maven, Gradle, npm, PyPI, RubyGems, Docker, NuGet, etc.
    Repository Lifecycle:
        Repository creation, configuration, cleanup policies.

3. Artifact Management

    Publishing Artifacts:
        Uploading build outputs (e.g., JARs, WARs) to Nexus using build tools like Maven, Gradle, or scripts.
    Dependency Resolution:
        Configuring build tools to pull dependencies from Nexus.
    Retention and Cleanup:
        Implementing policies to manage storage by removing old, unused artifacts.

4. Integration with CI/CD Pipelines

    Build Tools Integration:
        Integrating Nexus with Maven, Gradle, npm, etc., in CI/CD pipelines.
    Automation:
        Using APIs or CLI for artifact uploads and repository management.
    GitHub Actions/CI Tools:
        Pushing artifacts from GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, etc., to Nexus.

5. Docker and Containerized Workflows

    Docker Registry Support:
        Setting up Docker repositories in Nexus for storing and pulling container images.
    Integration with Kubernetes:
        Managing container images in a Nexus Docker registry as part of Kubernetes deployments.

6. Security and Access Control

    User and Role Management:
        Setting up permissions for teams and projects.
    Content Validation:
        Ensuring artifacts meet quality standards.
    Vulnerability Scanning (Pro version):
        Leveraging tools like Sonatype's Nexus IQ for artifact vulnerability checks.

7. Monitoring and Maintenance

    Logs and Metrics:
        Monitoring Nexus logs and performance metrics.
    Backup and Recovery:
        Ensuring repository data is backed up regularly.
    Scaling and High Availability:
        Configuring Nexus for high availability in larger setups.

8. Advanced Topics

    Nexus REST API:
        Automating artifact management and repository maintenance.
    Custom Plugins:
        Extending Nexus functionality with custom plugins.
    Repository Federation:
        Sharing artifacts across multiple Nexus instances.

9. Compliance and Governance

    Enforcing organizational policies for dependencies and artifacts.
    Auditing usage and download statistics.
